Simple Index Management with PHP Language (SIMPL) is a strip down CMS for managing one-page website.

## Getting Started
This CMS will allow you to edit one html file, which is your index .htm/html file. It has low security (password only) but I can't guarantee it's safety yet. You might want to upgrade it to your specifications.

I recommend it to PHP beginners to play with. It's simple enough that a beginner like me was able to build it. Have fun!

### Prerequisites
* Remote Host (I still have issue using it locally)
* PHP 7.25 installed
* FTP client (I used gFTP)
* FTP credentials
* Browser (I used Firefox)
* Internet

### Installation
* Create a folder where the index.htm is located
* Name the folder eg. edit
* Upload the index.php and done.php files in the folder
* Using a browser, open the folder eg. http://domain.com/edit
